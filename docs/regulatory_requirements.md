# Carbon Disclosure Protocol - why to disclose

As the world takes steps towards building a climate safe, deforestation free, water secure future, ambitious corporate action is more crucial than ever. Disclosure through CDP provides the bedrock for this. As the world’s most comprehensive dataset, CDP's data both fuels and tracks global progress towards building a truly sustainable economy for people and planet.

As well as meeting the demands of your investors and customers, reporting your environmental data through CDP enables you to protect and improve your company’s reputation, boost your competitive advantage, uncover risks and opportunities, and track and benchmark progress. In a world where mandatory disclosure is gaining momentum, disclosing through CDP also helps companies get ahead of regulation.

CDP is the gold standard for corporate environmental reporting and is fully aligned with the [TCFD recommendations](https://www.cdp.net/en/guidance/how-cdp-is-aligned-to-the-tcfd).
